This is a place for putting all your game ideas.
Please make them in Microsoft Word. (sorry no notepad)
Also, When you add a idea to this folder please add a txt file for comments on it to.
For example, if my idea was a game called "Kewl Game" then I would create two files as follows:

RGDT/game_ideas/Kewl_Game.docx

this file would contain comments on "Kewl Game", this can be edited by anyone
RGDT/game_ideas/Kewl_Game.txt
